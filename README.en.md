## What is Code Hero?
The CodeHero_JS is nothing more than a project developed only by me (DegreeZer0) while I’m on my journey FullStack web developer, the game will be in constant evolution as I also evolve in this area; I intend to always bring new mechanics, stages, themes, new challenges and have plans for later can add roadpaths from other languages within the game
### About the Game:
CodeHero_JS is a Puzzle style game with programming involved; Its main focus (for now) is in JavaScript, the first 20 phases ask only the basic movement and subsequent phases already begin to have a theme of "requirement" to be completed in the style:
* Write in the Hello World console!
* Exercise a loop ending at 5
* Write a solution if/elseif/else
* ...

The goal is to increase this game more and more to the point that it can be used as a form of teaching for those who want to learn JavaScript and other languages in a casual style of play

## CodeHero_JS will be paid?
Being direct: Yes... but perai, do not get discouraged yet, what will be paid in CodeHero will be the functions to create custom levels, participate in the integrated roadpaths and also to play some custom maps that have requirements that will be established in future versions (This README.md will be updated together).

## Current tab:
***Active functions**
* moveUp(); <-- Moves up
* moveDown(); <-- Down
* moveLeft(); <-- Goes left
* moveRight(); <-- Moves to the right
* for () {}; <-- Can declare loop
* let x = ""; <-- Declares variable
* const x = ""; <-- Declares constant
* function x() {}; <-- Inserts a function
* if (x = "") {
    return "";
  } elseif {
    return "";
  } else {
    return "";
  } <-- Evaluates conditions
* console.log(""); <-- Logs from the console

## How to use:
* **move** => Can be used raw to walk at angles x,y without being able to walk vertically,
* **for** => Can be set to loop execution to shorten lines of code,
* **let** => Is used to declare a variable (Can be used well in loop),
* **const** => Used to declare a fixed constant (Hint: const w = moveUp(),)
* **function** => Compiles several acts into a single defined keyword,
* **if** => Used to do motion analysis to avoid incompatibilities and crash,
* **console.log** => Purely used to show what you need in the terminal.
